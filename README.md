## Shell Script Tasks

### 1. System Identity Report

Displays system information such as Linux distribution, kernel version, user, uptime, and date/time.

Run:
chmod +x scripts/system_identity_report.sh
./scripts/system_identity_report.sh

---

### 2. FOSS Package Inspector

Checks whether Git is installed and displays package details and version.

Run:
chmod +x scripts/foss_package_inspector.sh
./scripts/foss_package_inspector.sh

---

### 3. Disk and Permission Auditor

Analyzes disk usage and file permissions and checks Git configuration files.

Run:
chmod +x scripts/disk_permission_auditor.sh
./scripts/disk_permission_auditor.sh

---

### 4. Log File Analyzer

Reads a log file and counts lines containing the word "error".

Run:
chmod +x scripts/log_file_analyzer.sh
./scripts/log_file_analyzer.sh /var/log/syslog

Alternative:
./scripts/log_file_analyzer.sh /var/log/dpkg.log

---

### 5. Manifesto Generator

Takes user input and generates a short open-source manifesto saved to a text file.

Run:
chmod +x scripts/manifesto_generator.sh
./scripts/manifesto_generator.sh

---

## Dependencies

- Ubuntu / Linux
- Bash shell
- Git
- dpkg
- grep
- du
- ls

---

## Linux Environment

The project was developed and tested on a Linux system. Git was installed and analyzed using Linux package management and terminal commands.

---

## Report

The final project report is available in:

report/Open_Source_Audit_Report.pdf

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding Git’s origin and distributed design
- Knowledge of GPL v2 and software freedom
- Hands-on experience with Linux and shell scripting
- Understanding of open-source ecosystem and collaboration

---

## Conclusion

Git represents the core principles of open source: transparency, collaboration, and freedom to modify software. This project helped in understanding both theoretical and practical aspects of open-source systems.
